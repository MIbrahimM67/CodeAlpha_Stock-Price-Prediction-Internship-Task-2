# Stock-Price-Prediction-Internship-Task-2


ðŸ“ˆ **Stock Price Prediction with LSTM ðŸš€**  
In this project, I embarked on an exciting journey into the realm of stock market analysis and prediction. 
Leveraging the power of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, I focused on forecasting future stock prices based on historical data. This project allowed me to gain deep insights into time-series forecasting, a critical aspect of financial analysis.

**Technologies and Tools Utilized:**  
- **Python:** Served as the backbone for the entire project, enabling data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization, as well as the implementation of the LSTM model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Provided an interactive and flexible environment for coding, allowing for seamless experimentation and iterative development.
- **Keras:** Utilized to construct, train, and fine-tune the LSTM model, facilitating the handling of sequential data and capturing intricate patterns within the stock price movements.

Overall, this project not only enhanced my understanding of machine learning techniques but also demonstrated the potential of deep learning in financial forecasting.
